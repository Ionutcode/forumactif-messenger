# Forumactif Messenger
Forumactif Messenger (or "FAM" for short) is a JavaScript application or "plugin" that integrates with [Forumotion](https://www.forumotion.com/) forums to enable instant messaging in topics in the style of a SMS app. It allows you to [view topics and post messages in real time](https://i58.servimg.com/u/f58/18/21/41/30/w4f56y10.gif) without ever having to refresh the page. What it does is display your forums, topics, etc.. in a separate window from the forum so you can pick it up and chat with anyone anytime. Even when not using this application, members can still participate in chats by accessing the topics directly on your forum.


## Under Development
Forumactif Messenger is still under development and in the planning phase, so it is not yet ready for production. You can however, install the application on your forum for testing purposes to provide feedback to us. You can also help contribute to the project if you like as well.
