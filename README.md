# Forumactif Messenger
Forumactif Messenger (or "FAM" for short) is a JavaScript application or "plugin" that integrates with [Forumotion](https://www.forumotion.com/) forums to enable instant messaging in topics in the style of a SMS app. It allows you to view topics and post messages in **real time** without ever having to refresh the page. What it does is display your forums, topics, etc.. in a separate window from the forum so you can pick it up and chat with anyone anytime. Even when not using this application, members can still participate in chats by accessing the topics directly on your forum.

This application is currently in the early stages of development, but is available for use primarily for testing and providing feedback. Forumactif Messenger will aim to support ALL major forum versions that are currently available on Forumotion. Those included are.. PhpBB2, PhpBB3, PunBB, Invision, ModernBB, and Forumactif Edge.
